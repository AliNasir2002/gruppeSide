            <h2>Choice of semantic tags</h2>
            <p> In order to get an idea of which semantic tags to use and which <em>not</em> to use, we started with the most obvious source of information we have as students: 
                the lectures of our course on HTML and CSS, specifically lecture 2 and 3. This gave us a good idea of which tags exist and some examples of their usage. Examples 
                include using the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> to emphasize an important part of the text rather than &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;. 
                Finally, we supplemented the information found in the lectures with more detailed information found on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> as well as discussions found on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>.
            </p>
            <p>               
                Much of the content provided here was pretty explicitly asked for in the assignment. We tried to choose the HTML elements that seemed most appropriate, according to what we've learned so far, and what we understand to be best practice.
                In general, we have only used the html tags to provide structure, and chosen them according the content they contain, rather than using it for stylistic purposes - we used CSS for that.
                We tried to cooperate using different branches linked to a shared github repo, and as the the project grew we also saw the need for clean, readable HTML and non-redundant CSS.
            </p>
            <p>Some explicit examples of our html tag use include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We made ample use of the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> tag for all our abbreviations (we <em>may</em> have missed some).</li>
                    <li>We have used the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag to bundle together text, headings and images that belongs together so that <em>all the content within one article is part of one independant, self-contained piece of content</em>.</li>
                    <li>We have used <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> to bring focus to the parts of the text that we found especially important - text that should be <em>emphasized</em>.</li>
                </ul>
