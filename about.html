            <h2>Choice of semantic tags</h2>
            <p> In order to get an idea of which semantic tags to use and which <em>not</em> to use, we started with the most obvious source of information we have as students:
                the lectures of our course on HTML and CSS, specifically lecture 2 and 3. This gave us a good idea of which tags exist and some examples of their usage. Examples
                include using the &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt; to emphasize an important part of the text rather than &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;.
                Finally, we supplemented the information found in the lectures with more detailed information found on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> as well as discussions found on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                TODO: "Explain why you decided to include the different parts of your contents and discuss why the HTML elements you used to annotate them were the best option."
                    <br>
                    <br>

                Much of the content provided here was pretty explicitly asked for in the assignment. We tried to choose the HTML elements that seemed most appropriate, according to what we've learned so far, and what we understand to be best practice.
                We tried to cooperate using different branches linked to a shared github repo, and as the the project grew we also saw the need for clean, readable HTML and non-redundant css.
