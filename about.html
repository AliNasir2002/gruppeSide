            <h2>Choice of semantic tags</h2>
            <p> In order to get an idea of which semantic tags to use and which <em>not</em> to use, we started with the most obvious source of information we have as students: 
                the lectures of our course on HTML and CSS, specifically lecture 2 and 3. This gave us a good idea of which tags exist and some examples of their usage. Examples 
                include using the &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt; to emphasize an important part of the text rather than &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;. 
                Finally, we supplemented the information found in the lectures with more detailed information found on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> as well as discussions found on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>.
