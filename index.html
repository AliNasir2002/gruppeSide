                        Tormod has briefly studied information technology in the past, but made a switch to the <strong>aviation industry</strong>, where he has worked for a few years before the COVID-19 pandemic.
                        He now looks to return to university and finish a bachelor degree in <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>, and perhaps a master's degree.

                    <p>
                        In his spare time, Tormod mainly enjoys <strong>gaming</strong> or having a relaxed evening at a pub with friends. He works part time as a <strong><abbr title="Brukerstyrt personlig assistent">BPA</abbr></strong>.
